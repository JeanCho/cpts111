    "### Description\n",
    "This course introduces the algorithmic constructs used to solve a wide range of problems. An important component of this is developing an understanding of the ways in which information is stored in a computer, both in terms of fundamental units of information such as an integer and in terms of larger collections of information contained with a data structure such as a list. Along the way you will implement computer code to solve several meaningful problems that involve areas such as encryption and graphics. It is assumed you have no prior programming experience. This course use the Python programming language.\n",

    "## Course Grading\n",
    "### Programming Assignments\n",
    "You will be given 8 programming assignments to complete. All Python code written in assignments must adhere to the recommended [Python Style and Coding Standards](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gsprint23/cpts111/blob/master/PythonCodingStandardCptS111.ipynb); your TA will let you know if you are not adhering to these standards. **Programming assignments should be completed independently**. It is easy to detect code sharing, don't do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please upload assignments as attached .zip files to the corresponding assignment in Blackboard. Recall the site is https://learn.wsu.edu/. Please refer to the [schedule](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~gsprint/cpts111/schedule.html) for assignments and dates. All programming assignments must be submitted by midnight of the due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labs\n",
    "You will be given 14 labs to complete. Each lab will give you hands-on experience with the Python programming language to solve multiple problems. These lab assignments also give you the opportunity to put into practice the techniques and concepts covered in the lessons with the help of your peers and a knowledgeable teaching assistant (TA). You are encouraged to share ideas with your peers in lab! Take advantage of learning from each other. You will receive full credit for a given lab if both:\n",
    "1. You show up and actively participate in the entire lab by making a sincere effort to complete all of the assigned problems.\n",
    "1. You make a sincere effort to assist other students with the lab in the event that you finish before them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, you are awarded credit in lab for participation and effort. You may make up some labs if you have an excuse that is acceptable as determined by the instructor. You are responsible for ensuring you receive appropriate credit from your TA for these special circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quizzes\n",
    "Written quizzes will be given at any time to ensure that the material is understood and you are staying on top of the textbook reading assignments. Quizzes may be rescheduled for students that have valid excuses. To increase your chances of your excuse being determined \"valid\", notify the instructor no less than two days in advance if you are going to miss class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exams\n",
    "We will have two midterm exams and one final exam in this course. The final exam will be held on:\n",
    "* *Section 01*: Friday, December 16th; 8:00 – 10:00am\n",
    "* *Section 02*: Wednesday, December 14th; 3:10 – 5:10pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Participation\n",
    "You are expected to attend and participate in lectures and laboratories regularly, and to participate regularly in the Piazza discussions. Attendance may positively affect your grade at the end of the semester.\n",

    "#### Contesting a Grade\n",
    "If you believe that a mistake has been made with grading an assignment or exam, please speak with the instructor or TA within 2 days of the assignment or exam being returned. Do not wait until the end of the semester to discuss any grade changes. You need to constantly be aware of how you are performing in the class. Thus, there will not be any surprises at the end of the semester when grades are to be formally submitted. You should be able to view your grades via Blackboard. These will be updated weekly. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Course Policies\n",
    "Assignments are due by the established due dates and times (see [schedule](http://eecs.wsu.edu/~gsprint/cpts111/schedule.html)). You may hand in a programming assignment up to two days late (the weekend counts as one day), at a penalty of 10% per 24 hours late. Forty-eight hours after the assignment is due, you may no longer hand in the assignment for credit. If an emergency occurs, the instructor will accommodate the student as much as possible. Make-up exams will not be possible unless the student speaks with the instructor at least two days in advance. Emergencies do occur and rescheduling of exams because of these is to be determined by the instructor.\n",

    "### EECS Computing Policies\n",
    "You may read about EECS's school computing policies at the following site [https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/documents/2016/08/eecs-computing-policies.pdf](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/documents/2016/08/eecs-computing-policies.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Integrity Policy\n",
    "Academic integrity is the cornerstone of higher education. As such, all members of the university community share responsibility for maintaining and promoting the principles of integrity in all activities, including academic integrity and honest scholarship. Academic integrity will be strongly enforced in this course. Students who violate WSU's Academic Integrity Policy (identified in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 504-26-010(3) and -404) will fail the course, will not have the option to withdraw from the course pending an appeal, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration as defined in the Standards of Conduct for Students, WAC 504-26-010(3). You need to read and understand all of the definitions of cheating: [http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=504-26-010](http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=504-26-010). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to know and understand Washington State University Academic Integrity Policies. Copying and plagiarism of other sources will result in an automatic F on the assignment. For a second offense, an automatic F in the course will be awarded without the option to withdraw. University authorities will be notified and the proper procedures will be followed. Possible outcomes resulting from violating these policies include denial of certification into your program and expulsion.\n",
    " \n",
    "For this course both group (for labs) and individual work (for all other assignments, quizzes, and exams) will be required. All individual work must be completed alone. **Do NOT work with any team members on individual assignments.** You may discuss ideas with team members about problems related to individual assignments, but do not discuss implementation details. If help is required please ask the instructor or TA for guidance. We are always more than willing to help!!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about what is and is not allowed in this course, you should ask course instructors before proceeding. If you wish to appeal a faculty member's decision relating to academic integrity, please use the form available at [conduct.wsu.edu](http://conduct.wsu.edu).\n",

    "### Advice\n",
    "The fastest (and easiest) way to get better at programming is to program! This course moves fast and if you don't stay on top of the assignments, labs, and reading it will be difficult to catch up. You will do great in the course if you put the time in to learn the material on schedule and practice programming :)"
