    "Write a program to play the dice game \"Craps\" (craps.py). Craps is one of the most popular games of chance and is played in casinos and back alleys throughout the world. The rules of the game are straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (called \"craps\"), the player loses (i.e. the \"house\" wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then the sum becomes the player's \"point.\" To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you \"make your point.\" The player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point."

    "### Program Details\n",
    "Write a program that implements a craps game according to the above rules. The game should allow for wagering. This means that you need to prompt the user for an initial bank balance from which wagers will be added or subtracted. Before each initial roll prompt the user for a wager. Once a game is lost or won, the bank balance should be adjusted. **Wagers must be less than or equal to the available bank balance.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You only need to prompt for a wager before each *initial* roll. You do not need to prompt for a wager before each roll when the player is trying to make their point. This is bonus (see below)!\n",
    "\n",
    "At a minimum, your solution must contain the functions below. These functions will help you get started! You are encouraged to define more than the ones listed as you wish.\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `display_game_rules()`: Prints out the rules of the game of \"craps\".  \n",
    "1. (5 pts) `get_bank_balance()`: Prompts the player for an initial bank balance from which wagering will be added or subtracted. The player entered bank balance (in dollars, i.e. \\$100.00) is returned.\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `get_wager_amount()`: Prompts the player for a wager on a particular roll. The wager is returned.\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `is_valid_wager_amount(wager, balance)`: Checks to see if the wager is within the limits of the player's available balance. This functions is a *predicate* function:\n",
    "    * If the wager exceeds the player's allowable balance, then `False` is returned; otherwise `True` is returned.\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `roll_die()`: Rolls one die. This function should randomly generate a value between 1 and 6, inclusively. Returns the value of the die.\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `calculate_sum_dice(die1_value, die2_value)`: Sums together the values of the two dice and returns the result. \n",
    "    * Note: this result may become the player's point in future rolls.\n",
    "1. (10 pts) `is_win_loss_or_point(sum_dice)`: Determines the result of the first dice roll.\n",
    "    * If the sum is 7 or 11 on the roll, the player wins and \"win\" is returned. \n",
    "    * If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (called \"craps\"), the player loses (i.e. the \"house\" wins) and \"loss\" is returned. \n",
    "    * If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then the sum becomes the player's \"point\" and \"point\" is returned.\n",
    "1. (10 pts) `is_point_loss_or_neither(sum_dice, point_value)`: Determines the result of any successive roll after the first roll. \n",
    "    * If `sum_dice` is the `point_value`, then \"point\" is returned. \n",
    "    * If `sum_dice` is a 7, then \"loss\" is returned\n",
    "    * Otherwise, \"neither\" is returned.\n",
    "1. (30 pts) `main()`: Makes use of the above functions in order to play the game of craps as explained above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you will most likely define more functions than the ones listed above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As the game progresses, print various \"chatter\" messages based on the number of rolls taken so far by the player, the current balance, and whether or not the player just won his roll such as, \"Sorry, you busted!\", or \"Oh, you're going for broke, huh?\", or \"Aw câ€™mon, take a chance!\", or \"You're up big, now's the time to cash in your chips!\" Use function(s) to do this!"

    "* 80 pts for adherence to functional decomposition stated above (see the individual points above).\n",
    "* 10 pts for defining function(s) to display chatter messages based on the current state of the game.\n",
    "* 10 pts for adherence to proper programming style established for the class and comments."
